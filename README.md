### Allowed values

sudo systemctl status syncraft-backlash-watcher.service
```

#### `bootVideo`

Will be the video played on boot. Must be a string with any of the file names (with extension) from the `boot_videos` directory.

#### `welcomeScreen`

Set this to `true` if you want the `first_boot.mp4` video to play once on the next startup.
